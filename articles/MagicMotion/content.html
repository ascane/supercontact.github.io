You appear to be trapped in a strange place for an unknown reason, and you are surrounded by dangerous monsters. Can you fend off all the enemies using your powerful magic skills and survive until the end? Let's wait and see..."</i><br>
		MagicMotion is a game that is played with your hand - not your hand on a mouse, but your hand doing magic gestures in the air! With a Leap Motion sensing device capturing your hand movements, you acquired the ability to cast spells by drawing runes or doing gestures mid-air. You can rotate the view by pointing to the edge of the screen (primary hand) and move around with keyboard (secondary hand). You are put in a large arena facing lots of enemies of different types. Defend your self!
